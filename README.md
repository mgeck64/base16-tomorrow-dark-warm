# Base16 Tomorrow Dark Warm Syntax Theme

Modification of the Atom Base16 Tomorrow Dark syntax theme.

Modifications include warmer but mostly very dark background colors for the
editor and UI, and a few other small UI changes.

This theme was designed to work with the One Dark UI theme, which is needed to
get the UI background colors, and which is the UI theme used in the screenshot.
