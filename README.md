# Base16 Tomorrow Dark Warm Syntax Theme

Modification of the Atom Base16 Tomorrow Dark syntax theme.

Modifications include a neutral background for the editor and a warmer background
color for the rest of the UI, and slight changes to a few UI elements.

This theme was designed to work with the One Dark UI theme, which is the UI theme
used in the screenshot.
